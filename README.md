The Digital Logic course has helped me understand the basics of how computers work. I learned about binary numbers, Boolean algebra, and logic gates, which are the building blocks of digital systems.

Designing circuits, like those used in calculators or memory systems, was challenging but very interesting. It was rewarding to see how these concepts are used in real-world applications.

This course has improved my problem-solving skills and given me a strong foundation to build on in future subjects, especially those related to computer hardware and system design.
